The following matrix is used to determine the 'diversification
multiplier'. The key represent the (closest value to) the mean
correlation of the assets. The sub-keys stand for the number
of assets. The values are the multiplier to apply to the position
size.

The idea is, that with more assets you can take on more risk with
your single positions because of the diversified risk. The less
correlated the assets are, the higher the diversification multiplier.

This is taken from Robert CarverÂ´s book: Systematic Trading (p.131)

    """Calculates the annualized volatility based on 'close' prices.

    NOTE: There are a couple schools of thought on which method to
    calculate the returns in this context is more appropriate:

    Log returns help normalize the distribution of returns, since raw
    returns are often right skewed. This may produce more stable
    volatility estimates.
    However, normal returns represent the true percentage change, so
    directly convey volatility. Log returns warp the magnitude of
    changes. In practice, both methods are used:

    Log returns are more common in academic literature as they aid
    statistical analysis. But normal returns are more intuitive and
    align better with how traders think in percentages. So there isn't
    a single standard approach. Using log returns has some statistical
    advantages, but normal returns may better match the reality of
    percentage changes.

    In summary:

    Log returns help normalize, but warp magnitudes. Normal returns
    directly represent percentage changes.
    Since you're building a trading tool, normal returns are likely
    the better choice for more intuitive and representative volatility
    figures. But log returns could be less noisy. It depends on your
    specific requirements!
